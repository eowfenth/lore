There is something intrinsic to the intelligent beings, something unique and elementary that shares among them as one particular trait, instinctive at the most and they do not even realize it: They are always a more interested in how everything is how it is than why and make. no mistake: it is not about ignorance but it i everything s like an instinctive behavior of solidity.
There are when, how and perhaps why consolidates to the present an to this little, dwellers from what ounce jar.  .     . was the Nothing know. The importance is not when it all started, not even how, though some says the Nothing swallowed itself, engulfed by its own vastness and emptiness and from its wounds, time and space were born. These wounds once opened, they couldn't be healed anymore. Pieces from itself were instructed to maintain control and watch over these multiverses, they didn't have a consciousness as we know, their behavior can't be explanated clearly. It is told that the origin is a kind of comprehension that overpasses the limits of those beings that dwells within its greatness.

Mortals are more interested in how this arrange works. Probably because of its life span.
